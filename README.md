# Python-Chatbot

This is a chatbot application built using the Tkinter library in Python. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the user's intent based on their input and generates a response accordingly. The chatbot can also perform sentiment analysis on the user's input and provide dynamic responses using template strings. The application has a simple user interface with a text input box and a text output box to display the conversation.
